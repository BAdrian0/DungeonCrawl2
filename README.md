# Dungeon Crawl (sprint 2)

## Story

Last week you created a pretty good [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game.
It already has some features, but the players have no opportunity to save their games.
It can be annoying, especially when you have to leave the game suddenly.

The gamer community is begging you for saving functionality and some other new and interesting ideas, such as:

- game sharing between players
- maps of different sizes
- player-tracking camera movement

Management is handing out a **prioritized list** of new user stories that must be
appended to the unfinished stories from last week in your product backlog.
Try to estimate these new stories as well, and, based on the estimations,
pick the stories your team can finish in this sprint.

> Using database for saving game state feature is a business critical item which overrides every other priority now!

Continue this entertaining project and make our players happier!

## What are you going to learn?

- Serialize objects.
- Communicate with databases.
- Write unit tests for your classes.
- Understand the **Data Access Object** design pattern.
